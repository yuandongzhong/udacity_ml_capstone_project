# Cat vs Dog Image Classification

The goal of the project is to use deep learning to classify cats and dogs in photos.

I chose the Keras library as the main tool to develop the model due to its easy-to-use design. I also used the transfer learning technique to lower the computation cost and increase the accuracy at the same time. 

The following model are used:
- VGG16
- InceptionResNetV2
- Xception
- ResNet50
